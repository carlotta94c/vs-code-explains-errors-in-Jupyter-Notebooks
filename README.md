# Copilot Explains - Error troubleshooting in Jupyter Notebooks

Data scientists and AI engineers love to work with Jupyter Notebooks because they make so much easier to look at the result of each and every data exploration step or data modeling experiment and take decisions accordingly.
However, Jupyter notebooks are not immune to errors and sometimes understanding error messages - in particular if you aren’t a native English speaker or you are a beginner - and troubleshooting code might be painful and time consuming. 

In this repo, you'll find the code shown in [Copilot Explains Episode 6: Error troubleshooting in Jupyter Notebooks]().

The original Jupyter Notebook (version without errors) along with the related documentation is taken from [Lesson 4 - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression/4-Logistic) of the [Machine Learning for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/) open-source curriculum.

⚠️ **The notebook included in this repo contains errors for didactic purposes.** You can use this as a base to follow along with the [video content]() and troubleshoot the errors with GitHub Copilot and VS Code. 

## Pre-requisites
